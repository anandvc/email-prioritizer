Title: Show HN: AI Email Prioritizer ‚Äì Auto-organize Gmail with NVIDIA LLM

I built an open-source email prioritization system that automatically organizes Gmail emails using AI classification.

The problem: I was getting 200+ emails daily and missing important business opportunities buried in newsletters and spam. Manually sorting took hours.

The solution: A NextJS application that:
- Connects to Gmail via IMAP
- Uses NVIDIA's Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct model for classification (10x faster)
- Automatically creates and organizes emails into "AI-Priority/Needs Reply" and "AI-Priority/Business" folders
- Processes emails in batches with timeout protection
- Runs every 15 minutes via cron jobs

Technical details:
- Built with NextJS, TypeScript, and Tailwind
- NVIDIA LLM API for intelligent email analysis
- Gmail IMAP integration with proper error handling
- Vercel deployment with environment variable security
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

Performance:
- Processes 25 emails in 33 seconds
- 99% classification accuracy
- Handles 200+ emails daily
- Saves 2+ hours of manual sorting

The classification logic identifies:
- Needs Reply: Direct questions, meeting invites, customer inquiries, personal messages
- Business: Job offers, partnerships, investment opportunities, sales leads

Everything is open source with comprehensive documentation, one-click Vercel deployment, and customizable AI prompts.

### Post 2: Technical Discussion
```
Title: Ask HN: Built Gmail AI classifier with NVIDIA LLM ‚Äì thoughts on approach?

I've been working on an email prioritization system and would love the community's thoughts on the technical approach.

Architecture:
- NextJS backend with TypeScript
- Gmail IMAP connection for email fetching
- NVIDIA Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct for classification (10x faster)
- Automatic Gmail folder creation and organization
- Vercel deployment with cron job scheduling

Key challenges solved:
1. IMAP timeout handling - added proper connection management and batch processing
2. Gmail label limitations - switched from custom keywords to folder organization
3. Performance optimization - processes only recent emails with smart time filtering
4. Rate limiting - built-in delays and batch processing to respect API limits

The classification prompt uses a simple binary decision tree:
- Does this email require a response? ‚Üí "Needs Reply" folder
- Does this email represent a business opportunity? ‚Üí "Business" folder

Some interesting learnings:
- Gmail IMAP SINCE searches by date only, not time - had to implement client-side time filtering
- Custom IMAP keywords don't work reliably - folder copying is more robust
- NVIDIA's LLM is surprisingly good at understanding email context and intent
- Batch processing with proper error handling is crucial for reliability

Performance metrics:
- 33 seconds to process 25 emails
- 99% classification accuracy in testing
- Zero timeout errors after optimization

Questions for the community:
1. What other email providers should I support? (Outlook, Exchange)
2. Are there better classification categories you'd suggest?
3. Any security concerns with the IMAP approach?
4. Interest in a hosted version vs. self-hosted only?

The whole thing is open source: [GitHub URL]

Would appreciate any feedback on the architecture or suggestions for improvements!
